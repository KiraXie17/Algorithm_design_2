General Idea about the piece that I have created
-----
key word: pop art, strong color contrastion.
The background is empty and plain, but the darkness is not what I want to see. I want to see colors, contradiction, and collision. 
this art piece is constantly changing, but at the end, everything would come to the center of the canvas, but everything is also getting bigger and bigger.
which symbolize the law of the nature and the society. Even though we all come from different directions, at the end of the day, we will all come back home.
